How to Create a Discord Bot
This guide will walk you through the steps to create a simple Discord bot using Node.js and Discord.js.

Step 1: Set Up a Discord Account
Create a Discord account if you don't already have one by visiting https://discord.com.

Step 2: Set Up a Discord Developer Account
1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal (https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Log in with your Discord account.
3. Click on the "New Application" button.
4. Name your application (this will be the name of your bot) and click "Create".

Step 3: Create the Bot
5. In the application dashboard, go to the "Bot" section on the left sidebar.
6. Click "Add Bot".
7. Customize your bot (like setting its username and icon).
8. Save the Token provided here. You'll need it to authenticate your bot in your code. Keep it safe.

Step 4: Set Bot Permissions
9. Under the "OAuth2" section in the Developer Portal, select "URL Generator".
10. Choose "bot" under scopes.
11. Under "OAuth2 URL Generator", choose the permissions you want to grant your bot (e.g., sending messages, managing roles, etc.).
12. Copy the generated URL and paste it in your browser to invite the bot to your server.

Step 5: Install Required Software
Install Node.js: Download and install the latest version of Node.js from https://nodejs.org.

Install Discord.js: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the Discord.js library:
npm install discord.js (prompt)

Create a new folder on your computer where you want to store your bot's files.
In the folder, create a new file named bot.js (or any name you prefer).
Add the following code to your file:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const { Client, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js');
const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds, GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages, GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent] });

// Replace 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN' with your bot's token
client.login('YOUR_BOT_TOKEN');

client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log('Bot is online!');
});

client.on('messageCreate', (message) => {
    if (message.content === '!hello') {
        message.reply('Hello!');
    }
});

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 7: Run the Bot
Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the folder where you created the bot.

Run the following command:
node bot.js (prompt)
Your bot should now be online and will respond with "Hello!" when a user types !hello in the Discord server.

Step 8: Test the Bot
Invite your bot to a Discord server (using the invite link from earlier) and test it by typing !hello in the server's chat.
Step 9: Keep Your Bot Running
For development, you can keep your bot running by leaving the terminal open.
For production, consider using a service like Replit, Heroku, or a VPS to host your bot so it runs continuously.
